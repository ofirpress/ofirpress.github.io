At NeurIPS 2024, I will buy gelato for the team that has the highest combined score on SWE-bench Lite, AssistantBench, CiteME, and SciCode. Final submission is by end-of-day (anywhere in the world) December 3, 2024.

### Rules:
0. You may use any proprietary or open source model. 
1. All results must be pass@1. Agents are allowed to use the internet but you must make sure that they can't accidentally browse to a site that contains the actual datasets, thereby revealing the right answers. 
2. For AssistantBench we will only consider the accuracy metric.
3. There must be some type of public posting about the system being submitted, either a preprint or paper or blog post.
4. You'll need to somehow show me that you're not making up your numbers- either by submitting your agent trajectories or by letting me interact with your system. 


To make a submission, email me with your scores.
